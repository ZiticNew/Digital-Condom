# Digital-Condom
Digital Condom is a app designed to block a list of specified domains from loading on your device this is fully written in python then converted to an exe by pyinstaller.

# What You Need To Know

# Bugs
Occasionally, there may be a bug where pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal does not unblock the sites as expected. For now, I am including an app named Digital Debug to manually correct this issue. This will serve as a temporary fix until a full patch is implemented. If you run into a bug where the sites are no longer being blocked please run the Digital Debug.exe then restart your device if the problem continues reach out to me on the discord in the zips read me file.

# Why I Made This
This application aims to help protect users in VRChat from malicious loggers. Some individuals exploit vulnerabilities by inserting Grabify links into video players, which are then used to launch web-stress attacks on unsuspecting players and its just overall annoying.


# Disclaimer
By running this script, you acknowledge and consent that your Windows username and IP address will be logged and sent to a Gmail account and a specified webhook. You also should know that this only blocks certain domain and ip request apis this is not an all in 1 solution it simply defeats grabify abusers and other similar common ip logger services by blocking there domain names.
